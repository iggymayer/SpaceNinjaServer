## In General

### Prerequisites

Use `npm i` or `npm ci` to install all dependencies, including dev dependencies.

## Development Process

Auto reloading is supported for server and WebUI development. Simply use `npm run dev` or `npm run dev:bun` to start the server and edit away.

### Testing

Before submitting a PR:
- Use `npm run verify` to verify that the code is type-safe.
- Use `npm run fix` to fix formatting issues as well as be informed of any unfixable issues. Avoid introducing new warnings.

## WebUI Specific

The translation system is designed around additions being made to `static/webui/translations/en.js`. They are copied over for translation via `npm run update-translations`. DO NOT provide translations generated by AI or other automated tools.
